# React-Apps

We have to create three seperate branches for the different tasks.

1. First is Todo App
- You can checkout the source code on todo-app branch.
- You can download the source code by navigating to todo-app branch, then click on the code button appeared on top right corner.
- To run the Todo App you need to install node-modules by running "npm install".
- Also install jwt_decode by running command "npm install jwt-decode".
- After installing node-modules & jwt-decode, you can run the app on localhost suing the command "npm start" on terminal.
- You will be propmted to http://localhost:3000
- There you will see the Login page of Todo App
- After Login, you can see some Dummy Tasks already added, you can add new tasks,you can mark a task complete by pressing done button on particular task.
- You can also filter out tasks based on status.
